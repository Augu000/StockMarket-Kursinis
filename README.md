# 2. ðŸŸ¢ Body/Analysis

## 4 OOP Pillars

### Polymotphism

### Abstraction

### Inheritance

### Encapsulation

## At least 2 Design Patterns

## Singleton 

The UserManager class implements the Singleton pattern. This design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.<br>
The __new__ method is used to control the instantiation of the UserManager class. It checks if an instance already exists and if not, it creates one. This ensures that all parts of the application use the same instance of UserManager, which is crucial for coordinating actions across the system, such as managing user data.

## Factory 

The create_user method in the UserManager class acts as a Factory method. This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. <br>
In your code, the create_user method decides which type of user (Developer or Trader) to instantiate based on the type argument. This method encapsulates the instantiation logic and decouples the code that generates the object from the code that uses the object.
